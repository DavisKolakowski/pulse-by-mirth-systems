# Pulse Authentication and Authorization Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive reference for the hybrid authentication and authorization system used in the Pulse application. The system combines Auth0 for authentication and permission management with a provider-agnostic database design for venue-specific access control.

## Hybrid Authorization Architecture

Pulse implements a **hybrid approach** that combines the best of both worlds:

### üîê **Auth0 Integration**
- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with JWT tokens
- **Global Permissions**: Centralized permission management via Auth0 dashboard
- **Auto-Policy Creation**: Auth0 permissions automatically become authorization policies
- **Token-Based**: All permissions included in JWT access tokens

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database-Driven Role Management**  
- **Provider-Agnostic Design**: Users identified by `ProviderId` (works with Auth0, Azure AD, etc.)
- **Venue-Specific Roles**: Fine-grained access control via `VenueRole` entity
- **Relationship Mapping**: Direct user-to-venue assignments in the database
- **Flexible Architecture**: Easy to extend for multiple auth providers

### ‚ö° **Simple Controller Usage**
```csharp
// Auto-created policy from Auth0 permission
[Authorize(Policy = "read:venues")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetVenues() { }

// Venue-specific access controlled by database roles
[Authorize(Policy = "write:specials")]
public async Task<IActionResult> CreateSpecial(int venueId) 
{
    // Additional venue-level authorization via RBACHandler
}
```

The system uses a combination of Auth0 permissions for global access control and database entities for venue-specific role management to provide comprehensive, scalable authorization.

## Important Note: Public vs. Authenticated Access
The Pulse platform prioritizes public accessibility for venue discovery. Most core functionality is available without authentication to encourage user adoption and provide immediate value.

**Public Access (No Authentication Required):**
- Browse venues and their information
- View current specials and events  
- Read live activity threads and user posts
- Search and filter venues by location, type, tags, and vibes
- View analytics data (anonymized, public metrics)

**Authenticated Access (Permissions Required):**
- Venue management (creating, updating, deleting venues)
- Special management (creating, updating, deleting specials)
- Content moderation and administrative functions
- User and role management
- Private analytics and venue-specific data

## Permission Hierarchy

```
Administrator (Global Access)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Content Manager (All Venues)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Venue Owner (Assigned Venues)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Venue Manager (Assigned Venues)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Regular User (Public Access)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Database-Level Authorization
While Auth0 handles application-level roles and permissions, venue-specific access control is implemented through role-based policies:

- **VenueUser Table**: Links users to specific venues they can manage
- **Role-Based Policies**: Determine when to apply row-level security based on user's role
- **API Middleware**: Validates Auth0 permissions and applies venue filtering for venue-scoped roles

### Permission Checking Flow
1. **Token Validation**: Verify Auth0 JWT token signature and expiration
2. **Role Extraction**: Extract user roles and permissions from token claims
3. **Policy Evaluation**: Check if user's role requires venue-level filtering (venue-owner, venue-manager)
4. **Database Lookup**: For venue-scoped roles, filter operations to assigned venues only
5. **Permission Enforcement**: Allow or deny the operation based on combined checks

### Token Structure
Access tokens include:
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "read:venues",
    "write:specials",
    "read:users"
  ],
  "https://pulse-api.com/roles": [
    "venue-manager"
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Each role has only the minimum permissions required for their function
- Venue-specific roles are further restricted by database-level checks
- Regular audits should be performed to ensure appropriate access levels

### Permission Boundaries
- **Global vs Venue-Specific**: Clear distinction between system-wide and venue-specific permissions
- **Read vs Write**: Separate permissions for reading and modifying data
- **Content Moderation**: Special permissions for content management and moderation

### Audit Trail
All administrative actions should be logged including:
- User role assignments and changes
- Venue user assignments
- Permission grants and revocations
- Content moderation actions

## Authorization System Architecture

The Pulse application implements a simple, elegant authorization system where each Auth0 permission automatically becomes a policy with the same name. No configuration files are needed for permission-based authorization.

### Automatic Permission Policy Creation

The system automatically creates individual policies for each Auth0 permission with the same name:

- `read:venues` permission ‚Üí `read:venues` policy (automatically created)
- `write:venues` permission ‚Üí `write:venues` policy (automatically created) 
- `delete:venues` permission ‚Üí `delete:venues` policy (automatically created)
- `write:specials` permission ‚Üí `write:specials` policy (automatically created)
- And so on for all permissions...

### Controller Usage Examples

```csharp
// Global permission-based authorization  
[Authorize(Policy = "read:venues")]
[HttpGet]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetAllVenues()
{
    // Available to any user with read:venues permission
    // No appsettings.json configuration required
}

// Another permission example
[Authorize(Policy = "write:specials")]
[HttpPost("venues/{venueId}/specials")]
public async Task<IActionResult> CreateSpecial(int venueId, SpecialCreateRequest request)
{
    // Available to any user with write:specials permission
}
```

### Role-Based Venue Scoping

For venue-specific operations, additional authorization handlers check:
1. User's role (venue-owner, venue-manager)
2. User's venue assignments in the database  
3. Apply row-level security for venue-scoped operations

### Configuration Requirements

**appsettings.json** - Only basic Auth0 configuration needed:
```json
{
  "AUTH0_AUDIENCE": "https://pulse.mirthsystems.com",
  "AUTH0_DOMAIN": "mirthsystems.us.auth0.com"
}
```

**No additional authorization configuration required** - the system automatically:
- Creates policies for each permission with the same name
- Maps Auth0 permissions directly to policy names
- Handles role-based venue scoping through authorization handlers

### Benefits of This Simple Architecture

1. **Zero Configuration**: Permission policies are created automatically - no appsettings.json config needed
2. **Direct Permission Mapping**: Auth0 permission names are used directly as policy names  
3. **Simple Controller Usage**: Use permission names directly: `[Authorize(Policy = "read:venues")]`
4. **Immediate Availability**: New Auth0 permissions are instantly usable as policies
5. **Clean and Maintainable**: No complex configuration files to manage

### Adding New Features

When adding a new feature that requires permissions:

1. **Add Permission to Auth0**: Create the permission in Auth0 dashboard (e.g., `export:data`)
2. **Use Immediately**: Apply to controller: `[Authorize(Policy = "export:data")]`
3. **Assign to Roles**: Update role assignments in Auth0 to include the new permission
4. **No Code Changes Required**: The policy is automatically available

Example:
```csharp
// New permission added to Auth0: export:data
[Authorize(Policy = "export:data")]
public async Task<IActionResult> ExportVenueData(int venueId)
{
    // Immediately usable - no configuration needed
}
```

## Future Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- **Regional Managers**: Role for managing venues within specific geographic regions
- **Analytics Viewers**: Read-only analytics access for stakeholders  
- **API Partners**: Limited access for third-party integrations
- **Automated Moderation**: Permissions for AI-driven content moderation systems

### Scalability
- Role-based permissions can be extended without requiring Auth0 configuration changes
- New venue-specific permissions can be added through database configuration
- Permission inheritance and role hierarchies can be implemented as needed
